## **üìñ Overview**
This project is a part of the **Mass Reconstruction** plugin for **DarkLight**. Its goal is to **reconstruct the mass at the reaction point** using hit data from GEM detectors.  

Given the hit coordinates **(x, y)** and the angle of impact on the two GEM planes **(dx, dy)**, the model learns to map these values to:  
- **Momentum (p)**  
- **In-plane angle (ip)**  
- **Out-of-plane angle (oop)**  

This mapping is trained using **XGBoost**. Once learned, the model uses these three parameters (**p, ip, oop**) to accurately reconstruct the mass at the reaction point.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Usage**
To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Data  
Make sure all the required data files are placed in the `data/raw` directory. This directory should contain the necessary training and test files for the **electron** and **positron** sides, as well as the generator file. The generator file contains TrackID data that will be used for mass reconstruction.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Training Settings  
Before running the scripts, you need to configure the settings for training. The configuration file `src/config/config.json` contains several important parameters:
- **path_train_electron**: Path to the training file for the electron side.
- **path_train_positron**: Path to the training file for the positron side.
- **path_test_electron**: Path to the test file for the electron side.
- **path_test_positron**: Path to the test file for the positron side.
- **path_generator_file**: Path to the generator file, which is used for mass reconstruction later.
- **scat**: Set to `'n'` if physics effects are turned off, or `'y'` if turned on.
- **optimize**: Set to `'y'` if you want to optimize the model's parameters using Optuna, or `'n'` otherwise.
- **n_jobs**: Number of parallel threads to use for training.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Models  
Once the configuration file is set up, run the `train.py` script:

```bash
python src/train.py src/config/config.json
```
This script does the following:

- Filters and cleans the training and test data, saving the cleaned data in the `data/filtered` directory. The filtering process retains only data with valid `TrackID`.

- If the optimize flag is set to `'y'`, it uses Optuna to optimize the parameters for each of the models (momentum, in-plane angle, out-of-plane angle).

- Trains six models in total: three for the electron side and three for the positron side. The trained models are saved in the `results/trained_models` directory.

- Tests the models on the provided test data and stores the results in the files `results/results_scat.pkl` (if physics effects are turned on) or `results/results_no_scat.pkl` (if turned off).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Plot the Results
After training, run the `plot_results.py` script to visualize the model's performance:
```bash
python src/plot_results.py src/config/config.json
```
This script generates the following plots:
1. A heatmap showing the correlation between the true and predicted values for momentum, in-plane angle, and out-of-plane angle.
2. Histograms comparing the true and predicted values for the above parameters.

The plots are saved in the `results/images directory`.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Mass Reconstruction

Finally, run the `mass_recon.py` script to perform mass reconstruction using the trained models and the filtered generator file:
```bash
python src/mass_recon.py src/config/config.json
```
This script takes the filtered generator file, which contains only those `TrackID`s present in the training and test datasets, and performs mass reconstruction. The resulting mass reconstruction plot is saved in the `results/images` directory.
